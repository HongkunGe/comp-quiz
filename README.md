# Front-end Quiz application

The application is used for quiz in computer science course. It is hosted in IBM Bluemix. Back-end of 
this application is generated by Google Apps Script.

The project is based on Martin Hawskey's Post. You can find his post [here](https://mashe.hawksey.info/2014/07/google-sheets-as-a-database-insert-with-apps-script-using-postget-methods-with-ajax-example/) for a reference.

I have migrated the app from Bluemix to Carolina Cloud. Please check [here](http://quiz-hongkun.apps.unc.edu/)
